# TODOS

## Observations

* Ensure design is appropriately responsive. [High Priority]
* Lots of sloppy code in this repo. Worth your time to clean out dead code and format some. [High Priority]
* Vistelse needs some further observations and tinkering to make it better. [Med Priority]

## Splash

* Use localSession to track end of home page animations, do not repeat them to a user who has seen them already during session. [Medium Priority]
* Consider increasing animation speed. Currently takes a while. [Low Priority]

## Vistelse

* Create sanity.io api for story creation. [High Priority]
* Implement textFadeIn/textFadeOut features from original project. Should smoothly animate words into view individually, fade out all when an option is selected. [High Priority]
* Implement scroll indicator for long text passages. [Med Priority]
* Implement intelligent scrolling to keep latest text in view, when text body will exceed visible space. [Med Priority]
* Add 2 stories to demonstrate the sweet cycling available in my app. [Med Priority]
* Should hide buttons from appearing before text has fully been animated into appearance [Low Priority]
* Make default styling of buttons greyed out - only hovered/active buttons should have the bright styling. [Low Priority]
* Story buttons could use background images to differentiate them from one another based on content or genre. [Low Priority]

## About

* Complete sections by writing more content for them. [Med Priority]
* Improve typography and styling of written content. [Med Priority]
* Active content cards need a larger section header - currently it is clipped by the top of the window. [Low Priority]

## Portfolio

* Clean up code. [Med Priority]

## Completed

* Story selection buttons don't really scale down on mobile. [High Priority]
* About/Portfolio pages need some styling. Currently the textwalls don't have a bg-col, not very readable or pretty.
* Convert page into about/portfolio hybrid.
* Under existing content, create a "My Work" section with content below.
* Portfolio and About pages can likely be combined
* In mobile view, when hamburger menu is opened and then closed it switches quickly from left alignment to center alignment before disappearing from view.
* After removing the Portfolio page, the navbar may be broken and some content may need to be trimmed from the home page.
* Text modals on those 2 pages need to be standardized.
* Pycharm keybindings.
* Styling is kind of ugly on desktop version. Lots of extremely wide text modals.. Especially the one with the buttons at the bottom. Would look better more compact.
* Recycle Portfolio Page.
* Recode preview window to use an animation rather than a transition - the purpose of this is to ensure it goes one way. The opacity fading out over time after the .active .card window has been closed looks bad as it immediately gets squished into a grid but slowly fades from view. [SOLVED - removed opacity animation]
* I don't have many good extensions for this text editor. [Med Priority]
