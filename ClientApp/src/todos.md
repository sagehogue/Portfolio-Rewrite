# TODOS

## Observations
* About/Portfolio pages need some styling. Currently the textwalls don't have a bg, not very readable or pretty.
* Portfolio and About pages can likely be combined
* Text modals on those 2 pages need to be standardized.
* Vistelse needs some further observations and tinkering to make it better.
* Ensure design is appropriately responsive.

## Home
* Consider increasing animation speed. Currently takes a while.
* Use localSession to track end of home page animations, do not repeat them to a user who has seen them already during session.

## Vistelse
* Implement scroll indicator for long text passages
* Implement textFadeIn/textFadeOut features from original project. Should smoothly animate words into view individually, fade out all when an option is selected.
* Implement intelligent scrolling to keep latest text in view, when text body will exceed visible space.
