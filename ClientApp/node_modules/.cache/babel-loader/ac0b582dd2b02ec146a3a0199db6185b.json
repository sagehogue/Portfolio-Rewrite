college town known as Chico. I moved to Portland as a young child and was raised there, immersed in the unique community and humanitarian culture of the town throughout my teens and early adulthood. I entered the workforce through the food service/catering industry, getting my start at a bustling local deli and moving on to do corporate catering work for locations such as Google and the University of Portland.</p>  <p>I soon grew to tire of the repetitive nature of the jobs I was able to get, and so I began to seek a more meaningful and gratifying way to earn a living. However, being a young man with little guidance or plan to speak of, I had no idea how to approach that. How could I develop expertise largely independently, open a career path, and build a future for myself?</p>\r\n                            <p>After reviewing my options, I decided to give web development a shot. I have long held a general appreciation for programming, but until I took my bootcamp at PDX Code Guild I was largely ignorant to what it actually was, and had never tackled anything more complex than a HTML web page. It was quite the leap of faith for me, having no real idea what I was getting myself into or even if I would be interested in it after a few months had passed, but my gambit proved a successful one, and after a few short months not only did I know how to create a full-stack website, but I had found a professional passion and industry to boot.</p> <p>Since bootcamp graduation, I have spent my time expanding my skillset and learning more about the industry I have chosen. There’s an unlimited amount of information and ability out there to be freely gained, and I ambitiously seek it out to arm my future self with the best possible problem solving techniques I can.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        </section>\r\n                    </PortfolioItem>\r\n                    <PortfolioItem label=\"Mission\"\r\n                        stateHandler={this.displayItem}\r\n                        fadeLabel={this.state.anItemIsActive}\r\n                        appearLabel={this.displayLabels}\r\n                        experiment scrollable>\r\n                        <section>\r\n                            <h3>Under Construction...</h3>\r\n                            <h3>Education Reform</h3>\r\n                            <p>\r\n                                As time and culture progress forward, modern society has less and less use for the dutiful worker.
